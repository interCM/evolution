Evolution package includes files:
evolution.py - main script performing simulation of the evolution
monitor.py - auxiliary module responsible for logging
config.cfg - template configuration file
produceplots.py - a module for visualization of the simulation results

Package is written for python 3 and will not work with python 2.
Testing was done with python 3.5.

Configuration.
The first thing you need to do after you came up with the idea of the
experiment is setting up of a corresponding configuration file. For this
purpose you can either edit an existing config.cfg file which is a part of the
package or create a new configuration file using config.cfg as a template.
All simulation related parameters should be included into configuration file.
The structure and syntax of configuration file should conform with the
specification of the python's configparser module.
Sections and parameters in the configuration file (see config.cfg):
[DEFAULT]
- This section is optional. If some required parameter from one of the next
  sections is absent the program will try to take this parameter from the
  DEFAULT section. If the program fails to find a required parameter in the
  configuration file it will be terminated with error.
[common]
interations   - required (integer)
run_id        - required (string)
runs_base_dir - required (string, a directory runs_base_dir will be created if
                          absent)
[environment]
primary_pos_base_weights        - required (see format in config.cfg)
update_origin_at_iter           - optional (space delimited list of integers)
pos_base_weights_switch_at_iter - optional (space delimited list of integers)
alternative_pos_base_weights    - optional (same as primary_pos_base_weights)
[population_1]
name                 - required (string, unique for each population)
pop_size             - required (integer)
genome_len           - required (integer)
mut_prob             - required (0 <= float <= 1)
ti_prob              - required (0 <= float <= 1)
sel_strength         - required (0 <= float <= 1)
children_number      - required (integer)
rec_freq             - required (0 <= float <= 1)
rec_rate             - required (0 <= float <= 1)
partner_sel_strength - required (0 <= float <= 1)
has_sex              - required (boolean)
male_number          - required if has_sex is True otherwise will be ignored
                                (integer)

Theoretically nothing prevents you from running 100 different populations
simultaneously. However, it is not recommended to start simulations with more
than 5 different populations.


Starting simulation.
When configuration file is constructed you can start simulation with:
$python3 evolution.py config.cfg
If everything goes fine [runs_base_dir]/[run_id] folder will be created. This
folder will contain a file with starting configuration (start.cfg) and
run_log.txt file, where data produced by the simulation will be saved. These
data contains normalized average weight, GI and number of mutations compared
to origin genome as well as weight after mutation, recombination and selection
for all offsprings generated during the iteration for each population at each
iteration.
Simulation progress will be shown in the command line.


Visualization of the results.
When simulation run is finished the data from the corresponding run_log.txt
file can be easily visualized with:
$python3 produceplots.py [runs_base_dir]/[run_id]
This will show you a figure representing the change of population parameters
in the course of the evolution. This figure will be also automatically saved
to the corresponding run directory ([runs_base_dir]/[run_id]).
